In silico serotyping

Install SeroBA (Epping et al 2018) as per instructions at https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/seroba#installation and git clone the database from the following link https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/seroba.git


Files required to run serotyping using SeroBA:
1. paired-end fastq files
2. Database
3. sample list (only for running on multiple samples)

Run in silico serotyping on a single sample :
serotype runSerotyping <full path to the database> <read 1> <read 2> <output folder prefix>

Run in silico serotyping on multiple samples:
1. create a list of sample names and save it as samplelist (e.g. the sample name for 24371_8#283_1.fastq.gz is 24371_8#283)
2. for f in $(cat samplelist); do seroba runSerotyping <path to the database> ${f}_1.fastq.gz ${f}_2.fastq.gz ${f}; done
3. seroba summary ./

Output:
summary.tsv
